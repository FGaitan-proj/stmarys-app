# St.Mary-s-App

A tutorial video can be found here: [St.Mary's App Tutorial](StMaryTutorial.mov)

This code was implemented in the summer of 2020, and our first attempt at developing an iOS application. 

The file uploaded is the directory developed on my computer through the swift app. 
The code that I, as well as my collaborator, Rachel Morrow, developed are the directories:
<br> Helper 
<br> Survey View Controllers
<br> View Controllers
<p> The assets were provided to us by St. Mary's Children's Hospital</p>
